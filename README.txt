This repository contains my solutions to the various exercises and problems
found through the book.

The solutions *should* match the expected outcome of each exercise, but that
cannot be guaranteed.

The solutions to some of the previous chapters have not been categorised
properly. Later chapters, from 7 onwards, are properly structured and are
contained within a folder that is named after the exercise.

The code is readable and mostly well documented. However, these are merely
suggestions -- there is always a more efficient way of solving the exercises.

Have fun learning Java!
