# Description #

This repository contains my solutions to the various exercises and problems
found in *Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, Comprehensive Edition, 11th edition, 2019* by Y. Daniel Liang.

# Solutions #
The solutions *should* match the expected outcome of each exercise, but that
cannot be guaranteed.

The solutions to some of the previous chapters have not been categorised
properly. Later chapters, from 7 onwards, are properly structured and are
contained within a folder that is named after the exercise.

## About the Code ##
The code is readable and mostly well documented. However, these are merely
suggestions -- there is always a more efficient way of solving the exercises.

# Most Importantly #
Have fun learning Java!
